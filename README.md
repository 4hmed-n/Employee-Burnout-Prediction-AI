# 🧠 AI-Powered Employee Burnout Prediction System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a **Multi-Model AI System** to predict employee attrition risk. It moves beyond standard regression by utilizing **Feature Engineering** and **Unsupervised Learning**.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Feature Engineering:** Derived `Tenure` from raw joining dates to analyze resilience.
* **Unsupervised Learning:** Used **K-Means Clustering** to identify 3 hidden "Risk Profiles".
* **Supervised Learning:** Trained a **Random Forest Regressor** (R² > 0.90) to capture non-linear burnout trends.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* Python (Pandas, NumPy)
* Scikit-Learn (RandomForest, KMeans)
* Seaborn & Matplotlib
